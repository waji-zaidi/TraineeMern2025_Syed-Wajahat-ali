**The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web . 1 In simpler terms, it's the language that web browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and web servers use to talk to each other. 2 Here's a breakdown of what HTTP is and how it works: Key Characteristics of HTTP: ● Request-Response Protocol: HTTP operates on a simple request-response model. 3 ○ Client (e.g., your web browser): Sends a request to a server. 4 This request typically asks for a resource (like a webpage, an image, a video, or data). 5 ○ Server: Receives the request, processes it, and sends a response back to the client. 6 The response contains the requested resource (if successful) or an error message. 7 ● Stateless Protocol: By default, HTTP is "stateless." 8 This means that each request from a client to the server is treated as an independent transaction. 9 The server doesn't "remember" any previous interactions with that client. 10 ○ Why is this important? While it simplifies server design, it also means that for things like user logins or shopping carts, mechanisms like cookies or session management are used to maintain state across multiple requests. ● Text-Based: HTTP messages (both requests and responses) are typically plain text, making them relatively easy for humans to read and understand (though often processed by software). 11 ● Port 80 (Default): HTTP traditionally uses port 80 for communication. 12
